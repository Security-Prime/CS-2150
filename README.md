# CS-2150
C++ applications
"CS 2150: Program and Data Representation" at the University of Virginia. 

In this course, we have implemented different data structures such as linked list, trees, and stacks without using their built-in C++ libraries. Also, we have used some assembly assignments, implemented Huffman coding and graphs. Huffman coding was one of the hardest assignments in this course.
